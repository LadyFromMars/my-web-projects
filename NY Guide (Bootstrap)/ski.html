<h3> PRE-ARRIVAL TIPS</h3>
<br>

<h4>What kind of shape do I have to be in?</h4>
<p>While skiing and snowboarding can be enjoyed without regularly exercising the body, we
  recommend preparing your muscles for the slopes. This includes, but is not limited to,
  toning exercises (knee bends, sit-ups) and stretching. These exercises will help to prevent
   torn muscles, muscle aches, etc. </p>
<br>

<h4> Skiing or boarding? Which is easier? </h4>

<p> Generally speaking, skiing is easier to learn but more difficult to master, and the opposite is
 true for snowboarding. However, everyone is different. Some people pick up snowboarding more
  easily than skiing, and some pick up skiing more quickly than snowboarding. The only way to know is to try it yourself!    </p>
<br>

<h4> I don't have special clothes. What should I wear? </h4>

<p>You don't need to buy expensive ski or snowboard clothes to try the sport... you probably
  have everything you need in your closet. <br>

Surprisingly enough, even though you're outside in the winter, you will perspire!
Layering is the key. You don't need to invest in specific clothing, but dressing appropriately
is important and may be done by selecting items from your existing wardrobe and wearing them in
suitable combinations. Check out the video below to learn more! </p>
<br>

<p> <strong>Pants</strong>: Un-insulated wind or rain pants and sweatpants under them can
  substitute insulated ski pants. Nylon running pants can break the wind, but sweatpants and/or
  long underwear under them are essential. By the way, don't tuck your pants into your boots.
  Ski pants are designed to fit over the tops of your boots. A note for boarders:
  snowboard-specific pants that have extra padding and waterproofing in all the right places
  are a good idea. Boarders spend more time sitting on the snow than do skiers. It's the nature
  of the sport, even for advanced riders. Good pants are
   invaluable! </p> <br>

<p> <strong>Tops</strong>: A long-sleeved shirt (a turtleneck is a great idea) with a sweater
   and medium weight jacket offers a variety of options should the temperature change. On very
   cold days, a layer of long underwear worn on the upper body is a great insulator and may
   always be removed if conditions warrant. A ski jacket with underarm vents can be very
    effective at regulating body temperature. </p> <br>

<p> <strong> Headgear</strong>: Cover your head! Your body loses 80% of its heat through your head.
   A hat is essential! A warm wool or fleece hat is ideal. Don't sweat "hat hair".... you can fix
   it after the last run and before you head out for drinks and dinner.</p> <br>

<p> <strong> Socks</strong>: Wear one pair of light to medium weight socks! Your boots are
  designed to keep you warm. </p> <br>

<p> <strong>Gloves/Mittens</strong>: Personal preference rules here. Generally, mittens are
   warmer but restrict dexterity. Glove liners are a viable option for some. Boarders tend to
   prefer long, waterproof mittens. Handwarmers are single-use pouches that produce heat for
   several hours and are used inside gloves or mittens. </p> <br>

<p> <strong>Neckwear</strong>: Leave the long woolen scarf your grandmother knit for you at home.
   It's a potential hazard. You're much better off with a neck warmer, a non-allergenic fleece
   tube that slips over the head and keeps your neck toasty warm. This wonderful, inexpensive
    piece of apparel is actually long enough to be pulled up to cover your chin, mouth, and
    nose. </p> <br>

<p> <strong>Accessories</strong>: Goggles protect your eyes from the sun and from the wind.
  Sunglasses are helpful but don't block the wind. Tearing eyes and cold temperatures are not
   a fun mix. On nice days, headbands are less fuss than a hat. Sunscreen and lip balm are
   recommended. </p> <br> <br>
